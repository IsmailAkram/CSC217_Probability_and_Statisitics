# 1) You arrive at the train station at 10 oâ€™clock, knowing that the train will arrive at some time **uniformly distributed** between 10 and 10:30. What is the probability that you will have to wait longer than 10 minutes?
#Train arriving uniformly distributed in between 10 and 10:30
#Scale being the total length from 10 to 10:30 (30 minutes = 0.5 of an hour)
dist = stats.uniform(loc=10, scale=0.5)
#Appromixating probability of waiting longer than 10 minutes (0.16 of an hour)
1 - dist.cdf(0.16)
# 2) What is the probability you will have to wait less than 10 minutes?
#Approximating probabilty of waiting less than 10 minutes (0.16 of an hour)
dist.cdf(0.16)
# 3) What time is in the 60th percentile of this distribution?
#60th percentile
dist.ppf(0.6)
# 4) What is the probability the train will arrive between 10:10 and 10:20?
#In between 10:20 and 10:10
#20 minues -> 0.33 of an hour 
#10 minutes-> 0.16 of an hour 
#Hence 10.33 - 10.16
dist.cdf(10.33) - dist.cdf(10.16)
# 5) Now say the arrival of trains **follows a Poisson process** where a train arrives once every half-hour. What is the probability that you will have to wait longer than 10 minutes?
#Poisson process of train arriving once every half-hour
dist = stats.poisson(1)
#10 minutes = 0.16 of an hour
#Wating longer than 10 minutes using the inverse
1 - dist.cdf(0.16)
# 6) Knowing that it follows a Poisson process, if at 10:15 the train has not arrived, what is the probability that you will have to wait at least an additional 10 minutes?
#Probability of train arriving in between 10:25 and 10:15
#25 minutes -> 0.41 of an hour
#15 minutes -> 0.25 of an hour
dist.cdf(0.41) - dist.cdf(0.25)
# 7) At what time does the train have the highest chance of arriving? Create the appropriate graph that corresponds with this belief.
#Exponential distribution of train arriving once every 30 minutes

# 8) Say the results for the midterm for this class have an average of 70 and a standard deviation of 10 (SCARY). What is the probability that a given student has scored over a 90 on the test? How many standard deviations away from the mean is this score?
#Scary midterm
mean=70
std=10
dist = stats.norm(mean,std)
#Chance of student achieving above 90%
1 - dist.cdf(90)
90% is 2 Standard Deviations away from the mean
# 9) What is the probability that a given student has scored below a 65 on the test?
#Probability of scoring below 65%
dist.cdf(65)
# 10) What is the probability that a given student has scored between a 75 and an 85 on the test?
#Probability of scoring in between 75% and 85%
dist.cdf(85) - dist.cdf(75)
# 11) What is the score that is most likely to occur? Create the appropriate graph that corresponds with this belief.
